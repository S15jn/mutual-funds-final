Statement 10: Revolutionizing Wealth Management: Insights and Predictions for Mutual Funds**
**Description:** The problem domain concerns wealth management for the common middle-class
people, focusing on Mutual Funds. Now why this topic there are very limited techniques for wealth
management like FDs, Stocks Trading, Crypto, Estate Planning, Corporate Bonds etc. However, all
of them require time, focus, significant capital, involve risk factors, and offer limited interest rates.
Mutual funds are investment vehicles that pool money from multiple investors to invest in a
diversified portfolio of securities such as stocks, bonds, money market instruments, where they
are managed by an asset management company (AMC).
The expected solution for this problem statement includes: We have live web scraped data of
Mutual Funds India, our goal is to present descriptive analysis to understand this data and their
patterns, then make predictions on the given data to forecast the future performance of specific
mutual funds, develop a dashboard to display past data and projections (frontend development
not required). Finally, create an AI-based recommendation system for selected inputs: AMC Name,
Category, Amount Invested, Tenure.
